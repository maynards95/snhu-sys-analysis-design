# System Analysis and Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?


    The client was the DirverPass company that was aiming to create an online resource for others to help them pass their driving exams. They wanted to be able to create appointments, take online practice tests, and take online courses.
What did you do particularly well?


    I think I gathered the requirements for the project very efficiently which helped set me up for success in the later stages of the project. 
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?


    I would change my UML class diagram to include class methods as well as the variables I included. More detail would help give clarity to the diagram.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?


    You gather the requirements from the user and try to eliminate bias in doing so. We have to think of the user's point of view and what gives them value to build them a program that brings them value and one they are satisfied with. 
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?


    I try to read what the requirements of the software are and start planning out portions of the code to piece it together as a whole. Doing small chunks after fleshing out the requirements keeps me from feeling overwhelmed.
